### 👨‍💻 About Me  

# 👋 Open to ML Roles  

Hey there! I’m passionate about using **machine learning to solve real-world problems** and turn ideas into things that actually help people.  
I’ve worked on projects ranging from **classification and regression** to **deep learning for image recognition**, and I love the process of **fine-tuning models, optimizing hyperparameters, and getting them to perform reliably in practice**.  

I’ve also spent time **deploying ML systems on AWS**, experimenting with **MLflow**, and using **vector databases** to build scalable, production-ready workflows.  
Before diving deep into ML, I came from a **software engineering background in Java**, which taught me how to design clean, efficient, and maintainable systems — a skill that helps me connect model building with real-world application.  

Lately, I’ve been exploring **large language models**, **retrieval-augmented generation**, and tools like **LangChain** to create chatbots and decision-support systems that actually understand context.  

What excites me most is taking an idea and **turning it into something useful** — whether it’s a model, an app, or a system that helps people **work smarter, learn faster, or connect better**.  
I’m always curious, love learning, and I’m open to collaborating on **ML projects that make a real impact**.
