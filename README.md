# Hi there 👋 I'm Perfect Mak

> AI/ML engineer-in-training • Signal & random processes enthusiast • building useful AI tools and experiments

---

## 🔭 What I'm working on
- Building an **AI agent for university applicants** (Flask/FastAPI backend + React frontend) to guide timelines, match schools, and help with essays — with international students in mind.
- Creating an **NLP / retrieval** stack: experiments with BM25, TF-IDF, and learned retrievers for better candidate ranking.
- Transfer-learning image classification project: comparing **DenseNet-121, EfficientNet, VGG16, ResNet-50** for pneumonia detection.
- Prototyping an AI-driven music tool: generate beats, add lyrics, and produce full songs.

---

## 🧠 Areas of study & interest
- Probability & random processes (power spectral density, autocorrelation, WSS processes)
- Multiple random variables, joint distributions, MGFs/characteristic functions
- Deep learning: transfer learning, autoencoders, anomaly detection
- LLM tooling & infrastructure (Python, Poetry, ZenML, Qdrant, MongoDB, Comet ML)
- Applied NLP: retrieval, BM25 tuning, TF-IDF, evaluation metrics (MRR, NDCG)

---

## 🛠️ Tech & tools
- **Languages:** Python, SQL, JavaScript (React)
- **ML / DL:** TensorFlow / Keras, PyTorch (projects may use either)
- **Infra & tooling:** Docker, AWS (SageMaker), Qdrant, MongoDB, Comet ML, ZenML
- **Frontend:** React (Vite)
- **Other:** Git, bash, experimentation + hyperparameter sweeps

## 🧩 How I work
- Prefer reproducible experiments and tidy data pipelines
- I like to compare classical IR techniques with learned approaches
- I favor clear evaluation (MRR, NDCG, precision/recall) and ablation studies
